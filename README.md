# Unclear Build Errors with Incompatible React Native Libraries

This repository demonstrates a common, yet frustrating, issue in React Native development: cryptic errors when using third-party libraries that are incompatible with your project's dependencies or React Native version.

The `bug.js` file shows an example of using a potentially incompatible library (in this case, a hypothetical library). The `bugSolution.js` provides a solution by specifying compatible version ranges using package.json or by switching to a better-maintained alternative.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to run the app.  You'll likely encounter a build error, the exact nature of which will depend on the specific incompatibility and your development environment.
3. Examine the solution in `bugSolution.js`.
