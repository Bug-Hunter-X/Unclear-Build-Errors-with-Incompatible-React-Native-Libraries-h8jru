This error occurs when using a third-party library in React Native that is not compatible with the current version of React Native or its dependencies.  The error message itself may not be very descriptive, often just stating that a particular module or component could not be found or loaded.

Example Scenario:
Assume you are using a library called `react-native-webview` which has incompatible dependencies.  You might run into this vague error during build or runtime.

```javascript
import WebView from 'react-native-webview';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://www.example.com' }} />
  );
};
```

In this case, if the `react-native-webview` is incompatible, you might get cryptic errors during the app build or when you attempt to render the `WebView` component.
