The best solution is to carefully check the peerDependencies and version compatibility of all third-party libraries in your project. 

1. **Check Package.json:**  Use npm ls or yarn why to check which version of the library and all related dependencies are installed.
2. **Update or Downgrade:** Update or downgrade both your React Native version and the third-party library to versions that are known to be compatible. Check the library's documentation for compatible React Native versions.
3. **Version Range Specifier:** Specify compatible version ranges in your project's `package.json` file using semantic versioning. For example:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-webview": "^10.0.0" // Example - Use correct compatible version
  }
}
```
4. **Switch to Alternative Libraries:** If the library is poorly maintained or has many known compatibility issues, consider switching to a different, better-maintained alternative that meets your needs.

Example bugSolution.js using a version range:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import WebView from 'react-native-webview'; //Assumes compatible version installed

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <WebView source={{ uri: 'https://www.example.com' }} />
  );
};
```
